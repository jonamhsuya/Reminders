# Reminders+
Reminders+ is an app built for users to schedule and edit reminders, allowing increased productivity and focus. While currently only having basic features, the app aims to implement more features than current apps that have the same purposeâ€”therefore, the emphasis on the plus.

#### Features coming soon include:
 * Additional repeat frequencies including by the minute, monthly, and yearly
 * An improved UI with a better way of handling past and completed reminders
 * Text-to-speech using Polly AWS to read out reminders for you
 * And so much more...
