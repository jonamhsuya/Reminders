When is a productivity-focused app, streamlining the process of planning your day. Often, the use of multiple apps to build a schedule can be tediousâ€”that's why When is integrating alarms, reminders and events all into one app. With a simple, modern UI, When makes productivity as easy as the tap of a button.

## The App
#### Currently, When allows you to:
* Schedule a When (an alarm, reminder, or event) at *any time*, instead of at 5-minute intervals
* View all of your Whens on iOS's native calendar app, putting everything in one place.
* Create recurring Whens that repeat hourly, daily, or weekly
* View current Whens and edit details
* View and reschedule completed Whens

#### Features coming soon include:
 * Additional repeat frequencies including by the minute, monthly, and yearly
 * A custom calendar in the app to eventually replace the need for iOS's calendar
 * Text-to-speech using Expo Speech to announce your Whens
 * And so much more...

Here are some screenshots of the app:
